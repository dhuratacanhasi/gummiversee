                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gummiverse was born from a love for creativity and candy. 
                        We saw how gummies could bring people together—whether through nostalgic childhood memories or the excitement of discovering new flavors. 
                        With this inspiration, we set out to create a space where gummy enthusiasts can explore, learn, and indulge.
